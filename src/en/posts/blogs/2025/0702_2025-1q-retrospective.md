The rainy season ended early this year, didn't it? Here’s the summary for FY2025 Q1.

## Number of Articles and Authors
Over the past three months, 58 articles were posted—an unusually high number recently. The total reached 769 articles. Two new authors made their writing debut, bringing the total to 66.

## Spring 2025 Newcomer Series
Last year, in April–June, we held an (irregular) relay series for newcomers as a spring project [here](/events/season/2024-spring/), and we continued it this year.
