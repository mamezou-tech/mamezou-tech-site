The scorching summer has ended, and it has finally become cooler. Here is the summary for the second quarter of 2024.

## Summer Relay Series 2024
From the end of July to mid-August, we held the [Summer Relay Series 2024](/events/season/2024-summer/). This was the second time following last year. A total of 12 diverse articles were published, attracting many accesses. Here are the links to all the articles.

## Reaction to English Translated Articles
The publication of GPT-translated articles, which started [from the previous quarter](/blogs/2024/07/01/2024-1q-retrospective/#英訳版記事の公開), initially had minimal access, but recently, daily access has been increasing, starting with the following article.

- [Deploying Kafka in KRaft Mode in a Container Environment](/blogs/2024/06/24/kafka-kraft-mode-in-containers/)

The original of this article is "[Deploying Kafka in KRaft Mode in a Container Environment](/blogs/2024/06/24/kafka-kraft-mode-in-containers/)," which is not widely read domestically. I believe that publishing in English is reaching a broader audience rather than a difference in interest range among software engineers domestically and internationally.
