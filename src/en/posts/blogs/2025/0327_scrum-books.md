## Introduction
I'm Ishida from the Agile Group. Although you may not glean much from the title, this time I'd like to introduce one of the books that served as a trigger for my decision to pursue the path of becoming a Scrum Master. By the way, I have never seen ワンピース.

When I was suddenly thrown into the role of Scrum Master at my previous job, there wasn’t anyone around who could teach me about it, so I devoured a variety of books. Among them, the book that sparked my growing interest in the role of Scrum Master—to the point where I even considered changing jobs to pursue it—was the one written by Jeff Sutherland, one of the creators of Scrum, titled "[スクラム - 仕事が４倍速くなる“世界標準”のチーム戦術](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B010COOG9O/)".

## Recommended Reading Order
Rather than reading this book from the beginning as it is, here is a suggestion for the order in which you might read it.

Since the book—written by Jeff Sutherland, one of the creators of Scrum—starts with the experiences that led to the creation of Scrum, please begin by reading Chapter 1, "The Old Ways Don't Work" and Chapter 2, "Before Scrum Was Born." Even just that will help you see how this book differs from others.

Next, I recommend reading Chapter 9, "Changing the World." This chapter describes examples of Scrum being used not only in system development but also in fields such as education, poverty issues, and politics. This section, too, is highly recommended as it gives you a sense of Scrum's potential.

After that, if you’re looking for what to read next, I suggest Chapter 7, "Happiness." You’ll see that Scrum is crafted with the idea of achieving successful product development by making everyone involved happy. One of my favorite quotes in the book is, "It is not that people are successful because they are happy. They are successful because they are happy." This is a principle I hold dear as a Scrum Master.

## Conclusion
Unlike other introductory books on Scrum, this book has a distinctly business-oriented side. Therefore, whether you’re keen to study Scrum or simply looking for a good read, I highly recommend giving it a try.
