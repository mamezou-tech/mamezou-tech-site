## Introduction

Since the "AWS Certified Data Engineer - Associate" was added to the AWS certification, I immediately took the exam. Here are my thoughts.

Due to a [Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/certification/certification-agreement/), I cannot discuss the detailed content of the exam. Please understand.

## About the Exam

The [AWS Certified Data Engineer - Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/certification/certified-data-engineer-associate/) is described as follows:

:::column:Exam Overview
The AWS Certified Data Engineer - Associate validates skills and knowledge in core data-related AWS services, including data ingestion and transformation, orchestrating data pipelines, designing data models, managing the data lifecycle, and ensuring data quality.
:::

There is a similar [AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/certification/certified-data-analytics-specialty/) certification, but it focuses on the ability to explain how AWS data analytics services fit into the data lifecycle of collection, storage, processing, and visualization.

I was mistaken in thinking that the Data Engineer was a replacement for Data Analytics. The Data Engineer requires abilities in orchestrating data pipelines, designing data models, managing the data lifecycle, and ensuring data quality.

## Application

The application for the exam started on March 12, and I was checking the site on that day.

I had assumed that the exam wouldn't be available until April, but I was able to take it immediately after the application opened, so I applied for the earliest available date.

Although the exam fee for an Associate exam should have been 16,500 yen, it was mistakenly listed as 33,000 yen, but this was corrected by the evening.

## Preparation

I started preparing gradually from the time the beta version was announced. The content was not much different from other certifications.

- Read the official guide
- Read related service materials on Skill Builder
- Solve official practice questions
- Read a book on data analytics preparation
  - [Mastering the "AWS Certified Security - Specialty" through Key Point Organization](https://book.mynavi.jp/ec/products/detail/id=137677)
- Watch related courses on Udemy
  - [AWS Certified Data Engineer Associate (DEA-C01) Exam Preparation Training](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-data-engineer-associate-dea/)
- Revise the content I went through when I obtained my [Data Analytics](/blogs/2022/12/12/aws_all_certified/#aws-certified-data-analytics-%E2%80%93-specialty) certification and refresh my memory from over a year and a half ago

## Taking the Exam

It had been about a year and a half since my last AWS certification exam in October 2022. I was a bit puzzled by the multiple-choice questions, but having taken CBT exams for Java, [UMTP](/blogs/2023/12/11/umtp_l3_challenge/), JSTQB, and bookkeeping over the past year, I didn't feel much discomfort. Also, I found the questions to be shorter and simpler than those in the Professional or Specialty exams.

The exam time was 130 minutes, but I finished with 20 minutes to spare and left the room.

## After the Exam

The results were not available immediately but could be checked on the portal site in the evening. It seems that results are not provided on the spot nowadays.

I barely passed the exam.

## Summary

- Here is the current status of my AWS certifications.

| Name | Abbreviation | Group | Issue Date | Expiration Date |

- I recently applied for [2024 Japan AWS All Certifications Engineers](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/psa/2024-japan-aws-all-certifications-engineers-apply/), and with this certification, I should meet the conditions until next year (as of March 2024).
- However, it has been announced that three certifications (DAS, DBS, PAS) will be retired in April 2024 ([AWS Certification Retirements and Launches](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/news/aws-certification-retirements-and-launches/)), and since there will be no higher-level certifications related to data engineering, I am speculating that a Professional certification might be added.
- Next year, five certifications will need to be renewed (it would have been eight without the three retirements, which is daunting), so I plan to continuously input knowledge and output it on this site.

## Bonus

- Taking the exam during the [free retake campaign](https://twitter.com/Moro_Cert/status/1750394343985475861) (for the first attempt up to April 15, 2024) can psychologically give you a bit of leeway (cannot be combined with a half-price voucher).

- Due to the impact of the weak yen, [exam fees will be revised](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/certification/policies/before-testing/#Exam_pricing) for applications from April 1, 2024. If you plan to take the exam, applying before March 31 can save you some money.
  | Type of Exam | USD | Old Fee (Excl. Tax) | New Fee (Excl. Tax) |
	| - | -: | -: | -: |
	| Foundational | 100 USD | 11,000 yen | 15,000 yen |
	| Associate | 150 USD | 15,000 yen | 20,000 yen |
	| Professional | 300 USD | 30,000 yen | 40,000 yen |
	| Specialty | 300 USD | 30,000 yen | 40,000 yen |
