This article is Day 1 of the 2025 Summer Relay series.

# Introduction
When you hear "making a plan," you tend to end up just lining up a to-do list.

However, what is truly important is to clearly distinguish and consider the three elements:
- **Why you are doing it (Objective)**
- **How far you will achieve it (Goal)**
- **How you will proceed (Means)**

This clear distinction of "Objective, Goal, and Means" is the key to project success.  
What novice project managers face when creating plans is the "confusion of Objective, Goal, and Means."

In this article, we will explain the basics of project planning to prevent this confusion, using both failure and success examples for concrete illustration.

# Essential for New PMs: How to Formulate a Project Plan and the Differences Between "Objective, Goal, and Means"

![Image illustrating Objectives and Goals](/img/pm/project_plan_objectives_and_goals.png)

As shown above, an **Objective** is the final destination, and a **Goal** is a milestone on the way there. Let‚Äôs understand the meaning of each.

| Term       | Meaning                                      | Example                       | Key Point                                        |
|------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Objective** | What you ultimately want to achieve         | Increase customer satisfaction | The fundamental significance or outcome of the project |
| **Goal**      | A milestone to achieve the objective       | 10,000 registrants in six months | Specific, measurable achievement criteria        |
| **Means**     | The methods to realize the goal            | Running advertisements, adding features | Concrete actions or measures             |

# Concrete Examples of Objective, Goal, and Means from Military Planning | Explained for New PMs
**"Objective is Paris, Goal is the French Army"**  
This is a famous phrase introduced as a planning guideline by German commanders to their subordinates before World War II.

Strategic-level commanders first indicated the "ultimate objective (capture Paris)." At the same time, they clearly distinguished and communicated the "immediate goal to be achieved (defeat the French Army)" to their subordinates.

* **Objective**: To capture Paris (the ultimate goal)
* **Goal**: To defeat the French Army (an interim milestone)
* **Means**: To launch a blitzkrieg with armored divisions (the specific method)

In this way, **Objective, Goal, and Means** are logically connected. However, if any of them is missing or ambiguous, the plan can easily go off track.

Project management is the same; if this distinction is mistaken, the plan will easily collapse. Now, let‚Äôs look at a failure example from an actual project site.

# Project Planning Failure Example | Typical Pattern of Means Eating Into the Objective
This is an example from the telephone reception system development at Company J that I was involved in.

* **Objective**: To accelerate customer support and increase satisfaction
* **Goal**: To have a system that can streamline reception operations up and running by the deadline
* **Means**: Feature development such as UI improvements

During testing, requests for UI improvements increased, and the PM focused too much on "creating a better interface." As a result, UI improvements snowballed.

The deadline was delayed by half a year, and the objective of increasing customer satisfaction was not achieved. In the end, the project ended in the red.

**Lesson**: Means exist for the sake of the objective. If means eat into the objective, the entire project will collapse.

This failure was a classic case of "means eating into the objective."

Conversely, if you correctly separate Objective, Goal, and Means, the plan will run smoothly. Next, let‚Äôs look at a success example.

# Must-See for New PMs | Examples of Successful Planning with Objective, Goal, and Means and Four Principles
On the other hand, at Company S, which provides a web service, they correctly distinguished Objective, Goal, and Means. They made their plan as follows.

* **Objective**: Increase the number of service registrations
* **Goal**: 10,000 registrants within six months
* **Means**: Taxi advertising campaign + offering a free trial of new features for free accounts

They reviewed the development plan multiple times with the planning, development, and quality assurance teams. Moreover, during the project kickoff, they shared the Objective and Goal with everyone. They also quantified progress weekly and managed it using the following metrics.

- Trends in the number of registrants (Goal: 10,000)  
- Percentage of registrants through advertisements (Target: 35% or more)  
- Number of users of the free trial of new features  
- Paid plan conversion rate (Goal: 7% or more)

As a result, the number of registrants reached 12,000, which is 1.2 times the goal. Registrants through advertisements accounted for 35% of the total. Furthermore, approximately 8% of free trial users converted to paid plans.

These figures show that progress was managed as planned. They also support that the clarity of goal setting was a major factor in success.

As such, successful projects without exception clarified the "Objective, Goal, and Means." So, how can we organize them for reproducible application?

What‚Äôs useful here are the four principles and the organization sheet introduced next.

## Four Principles of Planning with "Objective, Goal, and Means" for New PMs
- **Set ambitious goals**  
  Maintaining the status quo won‚Äôt produce change.
- **Express goals in numbers**  
  There is no such thing as "vague achievement."
- **Make a plan**  
  Going by the seat of your pants leads to failure.
- **Conduct reviews and progress management**  
  The real battle starts after the plan is made.

## Example of an "Objective, Goal, and Means" Organization Sheet for New PMs
Using the format below, you can immediately organize the "Objective, Goal, and Means" for your project as well. Sharing this table with your team during project kickoff or plan reviews is effective.

| Project Name                  | XYZ System Development Project                |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Objective (Why)**           | Example: Improve customer satisfaction        |
| **Goal (What)**               | Example: Reduce response time by 20% within six months |
| **Means (How)**               | Example: Add an automated FAQ response feature, improve the UI |

üëâ By simply filling in the right-hand column, you can create a plan with an unwavering objective.

## Checklist for New PMs | Are Objective, Goal, and Means Properly Organized?
- Is the **Objective** expressed as the "final outcome or significance"?  
- Is the **Goal** defined with "measurable numbers"?  
- Are the **Means** "concrete actions" directly linked to the Goal?  
- Are the Means not encroaching on the Objective?  
- Does the **entire team** understand and agree on the Objective and Goal?

# Summary
- **Always separate Objective, Goal, and Means**  
- **Be careful to prevent Means from eating into the Objective**  
- **Drive the plan with quantification and reviews**

In summary, when novice PMs draw up project plans, it is essential to distinguish "Objective, Goal, and Means." Doing so improves the accuracy of planning and greatly increases the likelihood of project management success.
