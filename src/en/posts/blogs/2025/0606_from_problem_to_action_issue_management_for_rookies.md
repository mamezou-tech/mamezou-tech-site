# Introduction

- "I have this vague feeling that the project isn't running smoothly..."
- "There's trouble, but I don't know where to start..."
- "In a meeting, I was asked, 'What are the issues?' but I couldn't articulate it well..."

Are any of you new project managers (PMs) worrying about these kinds of things?  
Problems are an inherent part of any project.

At times like these, veteran PMs often say, "Let's break the problem down into tasks."  
But what exactly is the difference between a "problem" and a "task"?

By reading this article, you'll gain the following benefits:
- You'll clearly understand the difference between "problems" and "tasks."
- You'll grasp why it’s important to view things as "tasks."
- You'll learn basic steps of task management that you can start using tomorrow.
- It will give you the momentum to smoothly advance your project management.

Let's develop the skill to turn "Oh no..." into "Let's do it this way."

# Start by Understanding the Difference Between 'Problems' and 'Tasks'
As you progress through a project, you'll often hear the terms "problem" and "task."  
Though they may seem similar, they actually have different meanings.  
Being aware of this difference is the first step to becoming a capable PM.

!["Problems" and "Tasks"](/img/pm/issue_problem_action.png)

I first realized that "problems" and "tasks" are distinct concepts when I was shown the above diagram in a training session.  
I still remember it vividly, and I refer to it whenever I explain the difference between "problems" and "tasks."

On the diagram, the horizontal axis represents the passage of time in the project, and the vertical axis represents the amount of output delivered by the project.  
The blue line is the target output defined in the project plan, i.e., the "ideal state," and the green line is the current output, i.e., the "actual state."

## Definition of a 'Problem' in a Project
A problem is the **gap between the "ideal state (target)" and the "actual state (current situation)"**.  
It refers to the "troublesome situation" or "undesirable condition" that, if left unaddressed, will or may prevent the project from achieving its goals.

We can express it as:  
**Problem = Target − Actual**

### Characteristics of a 'Problem'
Problems often refer to negative situations, events, or signs, and they are either already occurring or clearly about to occur.  
For example:
- The schedule is behind plan.
- Many bugs were found during testing.
- A customer complaint has been received.
- Team members' motivation is dropping.

### If You Leave a 'Problem' Unaddressed
- You might end up just lamenting the situation.
- It’s hard to translate into concrete actions.
- In the worst case, the project could stall or even fail.

## Definition of a 'Task' in a Project
A task is the **specific action you should take to resolve a problem, i.e., to change the actual state to the ideal state (Action)**.  
In other words, it can be described as a concrete initiative to eliminate the factors causing the problem.

### Characteristics of a 'Task'
Tasks are future-oriented towards resolution or achievement and carry a positive nuance.  
They clarify what should be done next in terms of specific actions or policies.  
For example:
- (To address schedule delays as a problem) "Identify the cause of the delay and create a recovery plan."
- (To address quality decline due to bugs) "Prioritize the discovered bugs and develop a bug-fix plan."
- (To address loss of customer trust) "Promptly apologize and communicate the response plan to the customer, and build consensus."
- (To address potential turnover from low team motivation) "Conduct 1-on-1 meetings with team members to understand their situation and consider measures."

### Benefits of Defining 'Tasks'
- It becomes clear what needs to be done.
- It’s easier to create a concrete action plan as a team.
- It becomes the driving force to move the project forward.

## Understanding with an Analogy
Problem: "The room is hot." (Target: a cool room; Actual: a hot room. The gap is the problem.)  
Question for converting to a task: "How can we make it cool?" (Obstructing factors: hot air, direct sunlight, etc.)  
Task/solution options:
- "Open a window to ventilate."
- "Lower the air conditioner temperature."
- "Set up a fan."

Simply recognizing the problem "The room is hot" won't cool it down.  
However, by defining the task "Turn on the air conditioner," you can move on to concrete action.

## Why Is It Important for New PMs to Distinguish Between 'Problems' and 'Tasks'?
Merely recognizing a "problem" leaves you stuck at "That's troublesome, isn't it?"  
That won't move the project forward.

By breaking it down into "tasks," you can finally say, "Okay, let's do this," and take concrete steps.  
That becomes the first step toward solving the problem.

Rather than being pessimistic with "This project is full of problems...," you can have a forward-looking discussion of "What tasks should we tackle to solve this problem?"  
If you get into the habit of speaking in task-oriented statements, people become ready to take action.

# Basic Steps of 'Task Management' — Proceed in Three Steps
Once you've converted "problems" into "tasks," the next important thing is to properly manage those tasks.  
This is called "task management."

## Why Do We Do Task Management in the First Place?
If you leave discovered tasks as they are, they can quietly grow into big troubles or impede project progress.  
Task management is the activity of reframing problems as tasks, recording them, and guiding them to resolution.

### Purpose of Task Management
- Visualization of tasks: Clarify what the tasks are, who will do them, by when, and how.
- Prevention of overlooked tasks: Prevent important tasks from being forgotten.
- Progress sharing: Help the team grasp the situation and cooperate easily.
- Accumulation of know-how: Serve as reference for similar tasks in the future.

## Three Basic Steps of Task Management

### Step 1: Identify and Capture Tasks (Task Identification and Recording)
- Keep your antennae up! Hints for discovering tasks
    - In regular meetings, consultations from team members, customer feedback, and your own observations—opportunities for task discovery lurk everywhere in your daily work.
    - Whenever you feel, "Hmm, something seems off," "This might be a problem," or "If this continues, we might be in trouble," that's your chance to spot a task.
- First, jot it down; create a simple "task management sheet"
    - Use whatever is convenient: Excel, a spreadsheet, or a commercial task management tool. Start simply.
    - Point 1: Record tasks in **actionable statements**.
        - Bad example: "Sales are below the target." (This is a problem statement.)
        - Bad example: "Increase sales." (This doesn't specify what to do.)
        - Good example: "Plan a campaign to acquire new customers and develop an implementation plan by [date]."
        - If a task is hard to phrase as a concrete action, you might temporarily keep a list that separates "problem" and "tentative task."
    - Point 2: Record the necessary information. At a minimum, record the following:
        - `ID`: Assign an ID to each task (e.g., KDI-001).
        - `Date Found`: When the task was discovered.
        - `Task`: What the task is, so it’s clear at a glance.
        - `Problem`: When, who, and what is troubled; describe the background and current situation in detail.
        - `Reporter`: The person who reported or requested the task.
        - `Owner`: The main person responsible for resolving the task. **Specify a person's name.** Assigning a team name can obscure responsibility.
        - `Start Date`: When the work to address the task starts (or started).
        - `Due Date`: When the task should be resolved. **Always set one.**
        - `Priority`: The urgency and importance of the response. Examples follow below.
        - `Status`: Not started, In progress, On hold, Completed, etc.
        - `Interim Report / Resolution`: Record the process and final outcome.
        - `Completion Date`: The date the task was actually completed.
        - `Notes`: Other special remarks.
    - Example of priority settings:
        - `Blocker`: If no action is taken by the due date, it will completely halt another team's work.
        - `Critical`: If no action is taken by the due date, it will completely halt your team's work (no impact on other teams at present).
        - `Major`: If no action is taken by the due date, approximately over 5% of tasks will be delayed.
        - `Minor`: If no action is taken by the due date, approximately under 5% of tasks will be delayed.
        - `Trivial`: Even if no action is taken before release, there is no impact on project schedule, cost, or quality, but it would be better to improve it.

:::info:Reason for using English letters for priorities
I prefer using `Blocker`, `Critical`, `Major`, `Minor`, and `Trivial`.  
The reason is that when you list tasks in project management tools or spreadsheets and sort the priority column, it will sort alphabetically, allowing you to arrange them in the intended order.

### Step 2: Brainstorm Countermeasures for Tasks (Task Analysis and Solution Planning)
- Consider the root cause of the task (dig deeper)
    - Let's dig a bit deeper into the background causes of the task. (For example: behind the task of delayed test environment preparation, there may be various factors like the responsible person being too busy, unclear procedures, or lack of necessary equipment.)
    - By addressing not just the surface symptoms but the underlying causes, you can prevent similar problems from recurring.
- Think of actions to solve it
    - Come up with several ideas on what specific actions can resolve the issue.
    - Don't struggle alone—actively consult with senior colleagues and team members to explore solutions from diverse perspectives.
- Clearly decide the owner and deadline
    - Clarify "who" will do it and "by when." Ambiguity will stall progress.
    - **Owner:** Always assign to an individual. If the actual person changes, promptly update the task sheet.
    - **Due Date:** Always set one. Tasks without committed deadlines might never be solved. If setting a deadline is difficult, consult your manager early for guidance. Establishing a rule that managers take ownership of unscheduled tasks and set deadlines can also be effective.
- Organize by priority and impact
    - It's difficult to tackle all tasks at once. Consider each task's importance (how much it impacts the project) and urgency (how much time you have to address it), and prioritize accordingly.
    - Using tools like an "Importance vs. Urgency Matrix" can also be effective.

### Step 3: Follow Through to Resolution (Execution and Closure)
- How's the progress? Check regularly.
    - As a PM, it's important not to simply leave it to the owner but to keep an eye on progress.
    - Set up a mechanism for follow-up, such as reviewing task status in a weekly meeting. Be careful tasks don’t end while still "Unresolved."
- Mark as "Completed" when done
    - Confirm that the countermeasure has been implemented and the task resolved.
    - Report "Resolved" to stakeholders and share the information.
    - Update the task sheet status to "Completed" and record the completion date.
- Apply lessons learned next time (retrospective)
    - Share in the team what you learned from this task.
    - It becomes valuable know-how for preventing similar tasks and for future project management.

# Tips for Sustainably Effective Task Management
- You don't have to be perfect.
    - Start by simply recording tasks.
- Don't try to handle everything alone.
    - Have the courage to call for help from seniors or the team when in trouble.
- The task sheet is a shared asset of the team.
    - Place it somewhere visible to the team.
    - Use a shared folder or project management tool.
- Develop the habit of remembering, "I wonder what happened to that task..."
    - Make time to review at least once a week and integrate task management into daily work.
- Incorporating a short "task review time" in meetings can also be effective.

# Common Pitfalls in Task Management and How to Avoid Them
Even if you start task management, it might not function well... To avoid falling into such situations, be aware of common pitfalls and their countermeasures.

## Pitfall 1: It Becomes a "Problem List"
Symptom: You only record problems or goals, with no concrete actions or progress toward resolution.  
This refers to cases where the task title or content is not framed as an action. Examples include:
- "Sales are below the target." (Description of the problem)
- "Increase sales." (Not a concrete action)

## Pitfall 2: The "Someone Will Do It" State
Symptom: The task owner is unclear, and no one takes responsibility to address it.  
Either the task is assigned to a team, or the owner field is blank.

Countermeasure: Clearly assign an individual owner for each task.  
This creates a sense of responsibility and significantly reduces task neglect or delays.  
If the owner changes, promptly update the task sheet.

## Pitfall 3: Tasks That Never End
Symptom: No due date is set for the task, or the set due date is not honored.

Countermeasure: Always set a due date and share its importance within the team.  
Tasks without committed deadlines tend to drop in priority and may never be resolved.  
If setting a deadline is difficult, consult the PM or manager to have them set one or establish rules to defer such decisions to them.

## Pitfall 4: Inconsistent Task Granularity
Symptom: Both large issues like "Server down" and tiny tasks like "Fix typo in a document" are treated the same.

Countermeasure: Break down tasks that are too large into manageable sizes.  
Conversely, group very small tasks together or manage them in a separate task list instead of the main task sheet.  
It's also helpful to share the team's sense of task-level granularity.

# Conclusion: Solving Tasks as Fuel for PM Growth
Rather than just lamenting "problems," seize them as "tasks" to be solved and translate them into concrete actions.  
This shift in perspective and practice will not only lead your project to success but also greatly develop you as a PM.

Task management may sometimes feel like a hassle.  
However, it is a crucial skill to keep your project running smoothly and to protect you and your team from unexpected troubles.

It’s okay not to be perfect from the start.  
Use the steps and tips introduced in this article as a reference, face each task one by one, and accumulate experiences of resolving them.

When in doubt, don't struggle alone—rely on senior colleagues and team members.  
I hope this article supports your first steps as a PM.  
I will continue to cheer you on.
