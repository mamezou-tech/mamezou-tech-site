## Reactions to Translated Articles

Access to the English-translated articles is steadily increasing. Although the proportion is still small, they are a welcome presence that helps to gain page views even when access from Japan is low during holidays.

## Advent Calendar 2024

The annual [Advent Calendar](/events/advent-calendar/2024/) was also held. I was surprised that entries filled up in about three days. This time as well, many unique articles were published. On the final day, we had a contribution from Takashi Egawa, a former Mamezou machine learning engineer.
