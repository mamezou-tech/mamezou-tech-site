The previous article is here [„ÄêÊ∫ñÂÇôÁ∑®„Äë](/en/blogs/2025/03/28/ir-remote-control-with-attiny13a_epi1/)

Up until now, the preliminary preparations have finally been completed. From here on, we move on to the main circuit design and program development.

# Goals for the Homemade Infrared Remote Control

The goals were set as follows:
- Include as much functionality of the remote (HK9493) as possible
- Powered by a button cell (3V)
- Low power consumption
- Keep component costs low

# Remote Control Operation Button Specifications

As a result of analyzing the infrared transmission data in [„ÄêÊ∫ñÂÇôÁ∑®„Äë](/en/blogs/2025/03/28/ir-remote-control-with-attiny13a_epi1/#%E8%B5%A4%E5%A4%96%E7%B7%9A%E9%80%81%E4%BF%A1%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%81%AE%E8%A7%A3%E6%9E%90), the transmission data (commands) for the buttons turned out as follows.

(0xNN) is the parity data, and ‚ÄúLong Press‚Äù indicates that the command supports long press so that brightness can be adjusted by holding down the button.
There are 3 channels, and by pressing the corresponding channel confirm button, only commands for that channel will be accepted.

# Circuit Diagram

![Circuit Diagram](/img/blogs/2025/0328_ir-remote-control-with-attiny13a/schematic.png)

There are 8 switches for remote control on the left, connected to the ATtiny13A via a central module (encoder).  
The infrared LED draws a high current‚Äîabout 50mA to 100mA‚Äîbut since the ATtiny13A cannot supply such a large current directly, a transistor is used.  
Due to the large number of switches and the connection via the central module, there is extensive wiring.

## Switch ON/OFF

On the left side of the circuit diagram, there are 8 switches. These serve as the buttons for functions such as turning the remote on and off.  
For beginners in circuit design (myself included), this may seem curious, so I‚Äôve illustrated three similar circuits above. Can you tell the difference in the OUT voltage when the SW is turned ON/OFF?

![pull_up](/img/blogs/2025/0328_ir-remote-control-with-attiny13a/three_circuites.png)

__Left__  
When the SW is ON, the supply voltage of 3V is applied to OUT and current flows. When the SW is OFF, you might expect OUT to be 0V‚Äîbut it isn‚Äôt!! It is not 0V because it is not connected anywhere and remains in an undefined state. Such a state is called ‚Äúfloating‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh impedance‚Äù and must always be pulled to 0V or a defined voltage.

__Center__  
When the SW is OFF, the supply voltage of 3V is applied to OUT. A current determined by the supply voltage divided by the resistor value (V/R) flows into OUT. When the SW is turned ON, OUT becomes 0V.  
If resistor R were absent, the positive and negative terminals of the supply would be directly connected, resulting in a large current and a short circuit. However, by inserting resistor R, the current is limited; when R is large (from 10K to several MŒ©), almost no current flows, preventing a short. In this case, the positive side of R is at 3V and the negative side at 0V, so OUT is 0V.  
This resistor R is called a pull-up resistor, and the circuit is known as a pull-up configuration.

__Right__  
This circuit is obtained by swapping the positions of resistor R and the SW from the center configuration.  
When the SW is OFF, OUT is connected to the negative terminal, so it is 0V.  
When the SW is ON, as before, the positive side of R is at 3V and the negative side at 0V; therefore, OUT becomes 3V.  
In this case, R is called a pull-down resistor, and the circuit is known as a pull-down configuration.

In the circuit diagram, all the buttons are configured as pull-up circuits.

## Pin Count Issue

The ATtiny13A has 6 pins available as inputs (PB0 to PB5), but PB5 also serves as the reset and is used during programming. Since using it might cause problems during programming or remote control operation (unconfirmed), it was not used.  
As a result, only 5 pins (other than 1 for RESET, 4 for GND, and 8 for VCC) are available. Furthermore, one of these is used as an output pin for lighting the LED during infrared transmission, leaving only 4 input pins in practice.

With only 4 pins and 8 switches, it is necessary to determine which switch is pressed [^1]. What should be done? I considered the following methods.

__A: Use ADC Conversion__  
Configure one pin as an analog input and, using different resistor values for each switch, measure the voltage to determine which switch is pressed.

__B: Use an Encoder__  
Feed the 8 input lines into an encoder and receive the output on 3 or 4 lines. The resulting binary (3- or 4-bit number) will indicate which switch is pressed.

__C: Use an IO Expander__  
Connect the 8 input lines to an IO expander, and let the IO expander communicate with the ATtiny13A via I2C (2 wires) to determine which switch is pressed.

When testing option A, I found that the ADC gives an 8‚Äëbit result (0‚Äì255 for a maximum of 3V), but with 8 switches it would be necessary to create 8 distinct voltage ranges using different resistor values. Setting the threshold ranges was cumbersome and the accuracy poor, often leading to misdetections, so this option was ruled out.

Option B can be implemented using an encoder circuit‚Äîthe SN74HC148N‚Äîand the number of pins required to connect to the ATtiny13A is just right.

Option C was judged impractical because writing the I2C communication program is troublesome, deviates from the main project, and would bloat the program size.

So, option B was adopted.

:::info
An IO expander is a circuit that expands (increases) the number of available input/output pins.
:::

:::info
I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit) is a communication protocol that enables multiple modules to communicate using only 2 wires (a data line and a clock line). It is commonly used for communication with LCDs and simple sensors. It is pronounced ‚ÄúI-Squared-C‚Äù or ‚ÄúI2C.‚Äù
:::

Looking at the datasheet (specifications) for the SN74HC148N [^2], the correspondence between inputs and outputs is as shown in the table below.

![function table](/img/blogs/2025/0328_ir-remote-control-with-attiny13a/sn74hc148_function_table.png)

In the light blue box, by checking the H/L values of INPUTS 0 through 7 and OUTPUTS A0 through A2, you can determine which switch is pressed [^3].

However, when only INPUT 0 is LOW (last row) and when all inputs 0‚Äì7 are HIGH (second row), OUTPUTS A0‚ÄìA2 are identical (all HIGH). Thus, when the switch corresponding to INPUT 0 is pressed versus when nothing is pressed, the outputs are the same, making determination impossible.

To solve this, as shown in the red box, an additional input named EI (which is always LOW) was added‚Äîbringing the total number of input lines to 9‚Äîand GS was added to the outputs to yield 4 output lines.  
This configuration produces one of 9 possible output patterns using 4 bits.  
When OUTPUT EO is LOW, it indicates that no switch is pressed; this can be used for determination, but in any case, 4 output lines are required.

Note that input pins must be kept HIGH when not driven (i.e. they are low-active); therefore, pull-up resistors are used ([see Switch ON/OFF](#„Çπ„Ç§„ÉÉ„ÉÅ„ÅÆon-off)).

You might say, "Then why not use a microcontroller with 8 available pins from the start?" but I wanted to create something using the ATtiny13A‚Äîconsider it a demonstration of what can be accomplished üòÖ.

## Bypass Capacitor

The capacitor (C) might not be strictly necessary for operation, but it has the following benefits:
- It smooths out voltage changes (noise reduction)
- It supplies power during sudden increases in power consumption

:::info
A capacitor placed in parallel between the power supply (V) and ground (GND) bypasses noise; therefore, it is called a bypass capacitor (often abbreviated as ‚Äúpass-con‚Äù).
:::

The program is designed so that in the steady state it consumes almost no power (below 0.1¬µA), as will be described later; however, when a remote control button is pressed, the infrared LED lights up. Although infrared light is invisible, like a normal LED it emits light. Since it is used for remote control, it must emit a stronger light than a typical LED so that it can reach the infrared receiver on the main unit several meters away, drawing about 50 to 100mA [^4]. This causes a sudden increase in power consumption and a voltage drop.

In battery-powered applications, the battery is fine when new, but as power is consumed, the voltage gradually drops. When the voltage nears the microcontroller‚Äôs minimum operating voltage, instability can result; however, including a bypass capacitor helps the circuit ‚Äúride through‚Äù voltage drops, allowing the battery to be used longer (and more efficiently).

# Program

The entire program is about 280 lines long.
- Approximately 90 lines cover header includes, #define definitions, and data array declarations  
- About 90 lines in setup()  
- Roughly 70 lines in loop()

The control logic (setup(), loop(), and other functions) exceeds 100 lines. However, because each section is well commented and structured with curly-brace blocks‚Äîand bit-level operations for register settings are broken out by line‚Äîthe overall content remains quite simple despite the large number of lines.

To achieve low power consumption, the following changes were made:
- Disabled BOD (Brown Out Detection)
- Changed the clock frequency to 1.2MHz

__Disable BOD__  
Although the supply voltage is 3V, if it drops below the microcontroller‚Äôs operating voltage (1.8V for the ATtiny13A), malfunctions may occur. BOD detects a voltage drop and resets the microcontroller to halt operation.

It is likely that before the microcontroller malfunctions, a low voltage would prevent infrared transmission (the forward voltage required to light the LED would be insufficient). Moreover, disabling BOD significantly reduced power consumption and contributed greatly to overall power saving.

__Clock Frequency Change__  
Basically, AVR microcontrollers can operate at lower voltages when the clock frequency is reduced.  
While the default clock frequency is 9.6MHz, for infrared transmission it is only necessary to generate a 38KHz modulation and a delay of about 450¬µs; a high frequency is not needed.  
Since the timer depends on the clock frequency (for generating the 38KHz modulation and calculating delay times), and to avoid lengthy calculations, the frequency was set to 1.2MHz‚Äîa value commonly used online.

## Data Declarations

After including header files and defining constants, each command is declared as an array.

There are 30 commands for lighting control, each consisting of 4 bytes (excluding parity), amounting to 120 bytes of data. Since, as mentioned earlier, the SRAM is only 64 bytes, clever optimization was necessary.

```cpp
const byte command_1ch_0[] PROGMEM = {0x91, 0x39, 0x52, 0x2C, 1};
```

The last element of each array is set to `1` for commands that support long press and `0` for those that do not, so that long press capability can be determined.

[PROGMEM](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/tr/language/variables/utilities/progmem/) is a special keyword in Arduino sketches that stores data in flash memory (program space) instead of SRAM. This allowed for defining more data than the available SRAM. Although the program size increased, it still remained within the flash memory capacity.

Compilation log
```
Of the maximum 1024 bytes of flash memory, the sketch is using 972 bytes (94%).
Of the maximum 64 bytes of RAM, global variables are using 1 byte (1%), leaving 63 bytes available for local variables.
```

## setup() Processing

Here, the registers are configured. Since you need to know from the datasheet which registers are set to what in order to fully understand the program, a mere glance at the code might not be sufficient. For details, please refer to the datasheet; the following is only a brief explanation.

The function `sbi(register, bit)` sets the specified bit in the given register to 1, and `cbi(register, bit)` clears the specified bit (sets it to 0).

__Port Setup__  
- PB1 (pin6) is connected to the infrared LED, so it is configured as an output port.  
- The 8 buttons connected to the encoder output HIGH when OFF (they are low-active), so PB0, PB2, PB3, and PB4 are preset to HIGH.

__Timer Setup__  
This is configured to generate a 38KHz modulated signal (a signal that toggles ON/OFF at 38KHz).

- Set the waveform generation mode to Fast PWM
- OCR0A = 31 is calculated from ((1.2MHz / 38kHz) / 1 (prescaler)) - 1 = 30.6  
- OCR0B = 11 is calculated to set the duty cycle to 1/3, i.e. (1.2MHz / 38kHz) / 3 = 10.5

The 38KHz waveform is generated using the microcontroller‚Äôs timer; therefore, in the program (within the loop function), it only needs to specify whether to output from PB1 (pin6) or not, resulting in very simple control.

The image below shows the waveform measured with a simple oscilloscope. The square wave is output at approximately 36.7kHz. Although it isn‚Äôt exactly 38KHz, an error of this magnitude is acceptable for infrared transmission.

__Power Saving Setup__  
The settings reduce power consumption of the A/D converter, although they only take effect during active mode or when using set_sleep_mode(SLEEP_MODE_IDLE), so they might not be necessary. In this program, the sleep mode is set to SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN.

__Read/Write for Infrared Transmission Channel Configuration__  
The remote control has a channel switching switch (with three settings) and a confirm button. Since the channel setting is used only infrequently after it is set, I originally planned not to implement it. However, since there was available space in the program, I implemented it. Note that all of the ATtiny13A‚Äôs ports are already in use, so there are no spare pins. After much deliberation on how to implement switching, I decided to set the channel based on the type of button pressed when power is applied (when the button cell is attached and the setup function is called).

|     Button       |    Channel Setting     |
|:----------------:|:----------------------:|
| Not pressed      | Saved channel          |
| Turn On Button   | 1ch                    |
| Night Light Button | 2ch                  |
| All On Button    | 3ch                    |

Channel settings are written to EEPROM, so the configured channel is retained even if the button cell is replaced.

__Interrupt and Sleep Setup__  

- The interrupt type is set to trigger when a pin‚Äôs state changes.
- Pin change interrupts are enabled on the encoder outputs (PB0, PB2, PB3, PB4).
- The sleep mode is set to SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN.

There are three sleep modes‚ÄîSLEEP_MODE_IDLE, SLEEP_MODE_ADC, and SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN‚Äîwhich operate as shown in the table below.

![](/img/blogs/2025/0328_ir-remote-control-with-attiny13a/sleep_mode.png)

Setting the sleep mode to SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN stops all clocks and disables the transmitting circuitry, putting the microcontroller into a deep sleep mode. All activity stops except for monitoring interrupts, so power consumption drops to below 0.1¬µA, nearly eliminating power draw.  
The only ways to wake from sleep are:
- An external interrupt via INT0 or a pin change interrupt
- A watchdog timer interrupt

Since pin change interrupts are enabled on the encoder outputs (PB0, PB2, PB3, PB4), a change in pin state (i.e. a button press) wakes the microcontroller.

## loop() Processing

__Main Loop Processing__  
This is the program‚Äôs main routine.
1. The program enters sleep mode using sleep_mode() and waits here until a button is pressed.
2. When a button is pressed and a pin change interrupt wakes the microcontroller, it waits 20ms to debounce.
3. It identifies the pressed button, retrieves the corresponding command data, and transmits the infrared signal (by toggling the infrared LED).
4. If the pressed button supports long press, it waits 100ms and repeats the process.
5. Once loop() completes, it is called again immediately, returning to step 1.

:::info
Debouncing is the phenomenon where a button or switch causes mechanical vibrations when toggled, resulting in rapid on/off transitions. This can trigger multiple interrupts from a single button press.

__Get Command Number__  
The outputs from the encoder (PB0, PB2, PB3, PB4) are bit-shifted to form a 4‚Äëbit number, which is used as the command number.

__Retrieve the Infrared Transmission Data for a Specified Command Number__  
As explained in [Data Declarations](#„Éá„Éº„ÇøÂÆ£Ë®Ä), the command data is stored in flash memory, so here the command data stored in flash is retrieved.

__Infrared Transmission__  

1. Generate the transmission data from the command data array by bit-shifting to create a 32‚Äëbit value.  
2. Calculate parity. The parity is computed as the exclusive OR (xor) of the data codes: `data[0] ^ data[1]`.  
3. Transmit the header: output ON for 8T, then OFF for 4T.  
4. Transmit the data segment: for each bit (obtained by right-shifting the command data), choose the clear wait time based on the least significant bit‚Äôs value.  
5. Transmit the parity, doing the same as in the header transmission for the parity data.  
6. Transmit the trailer: although an OFF period of at least 8ms is normally required, the following seems to work fine.

According to measurements with the IRremote library, T is 450¬µs. To measure this interval, the function `_delay_loop_2(loop_count)` defined in ATTiny13A‚Äôs `util/delay_basic.h` is used.  
According to the datasheet, `_delay_loop_2(1)` consumes 4 CPU cycles. With a CPU frequency (F_CPU) of 1.2MHz, that is `1,200,000[Hz]/4[cycles] = 300,000`, meaning 300,000 loop counts correspond to 1 second.  
With the argument being a 16‚Äëbit counter (up to 65,536), using `_delay_loop_2(30000)` produces a 100ms delay.

From this, to wait for 1T (450¬µs), `_delay_loop_2(135)` is used. The loop_count values for 8T, 4T, and 3T are as follows:
```cpp
#define headerMark  1035 // 8T (3450us): 3450*30000/100000 = 345*3 = 1035
#define headerSpace  510 // 4T (1700us): 1700*30000/100000 = 170*3 =  510
#define dataMark     135 // 1T (450us) : 450*30000/100000 =  45*3 =  135
#define oneSpace     390 // 3T (1300us): 1300*30000/100000 = 130*3 =  390
#define zeroSpace    135 // 1T (450us) : 450*30000/100000 =  45*3 =  135
```

# Conclusion

After some trial and error, I believe I was able to fully utilize the microcontroller‚Äôs capabilities to achieve low power consumption and low cost, while keeping the loop() function simple. There is one minor regret in that the ‚ÄúSleep 30 minutes‚Äù command hasn‚Äôt been implemented, but I hope to tackle that in another opportunity.
