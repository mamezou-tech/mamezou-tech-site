# Introduction
In our previous article, ‚Äú[Problem-Solving Method Using Cause-and-Effect Diagrams | Practical Steps for Effective PMs to Improve On-Site](https://developer.mamezou-tech.com/blogs/2025/08/05/problem_solving_with_cause_effect_diagram/)‚Äù, we explained **how to visualize on-site problems and derive solutions from root causes**.

In this follow-up article, we introduce **a method for leveraging the Future Reality Tree to set goals and translate them into an execution plan**. We will proceed through the following three steps, incorporating case studies from actual consulting engagements.
- Step1: Clarify "Intermediate Goals" with a Future Reality Tree
- Step2: How to Create an Actionable Improvement Plan
- Step3: Effect Verification and Revisiting Causal Relationships

# 1. Clarify "Intermediate Goals" with a Future Reality Tree

![Example of Setting Intermediate Goals Using a Future Reality Tree](/img/pm/problem_solving_set_intermediate_goals.png)

A Future Reality Tree is a method that replaces the **root causes in the current reality tree** with desired states and maps out the causal relationships up to the goal. In this process, you set **intermediate goals**.

### Role of Intermediate Goals
- Clarify checkpoints on the path to the goal  
- Serve as a standard for all stakeholders to share progress  
- Be used to prioritize and ensure consistency of measures  

**Note**: If the connection between intermediate goals and the final goal is unclear, review the causal structure. Also, updating the current reality tree periodically allows you to adapt to changing on-site conditions.

# 2. How to Create an Actionable Improvement Plan

![Example of Creating an Execution Plan](/img/pm/problem_solving_creation_execution_plan.png)

For an improvement plan, it's important to break down ideas into ‚Äúwho will do what by when.‚Äù

### Creation Steps
1. **Organize by impact and implementation difficulty**  
   ‚Üí Prioritize measures that deliver significant short-term impact  
2. **Clarify required resources and skills**  
3. **Create a roadmap** (including mid- and long-term perspectives)  
4. **Appoint responsible parties** and set deadlines  

**Key point**: Short-term measures are implemented to deliver quick results, while long-term measures address structural issues at their root. Ideally, combine both.

# 3. Effect Verification and Revisiting Causal Relationships
To enhance the effectiveness of the plan, **convert intermediate goals into quantitative metrics**.

### Examples of Metrics
- **Test automation rate**: target 80% / actual 72%  
- **Emergency release count**: within six months ‚â§ 3 / actual 5  

If not achieved, check the following:
- Whether the causal relationship hypothesis is incorrect  
- Whether there were flaws in the execution process  
Return to root cause analysis and revise the plan as necessary.

# Case Study: Problem-Solving Process in a Consulting Engagement

## Background and Challenges
A client company had been working on process improvement for many years. However, management voiced concerns that ‚Äúimprovements were not taking hold.‚Äù

The business goals were to **strengthen manufacturing capabilities** and **accelerate product commercialization**. We were asked to analyze the structural issues hindering these objectives.

## Visualizing the Problem Structure with a Current Reality Tree

![Example of a current reality tree visualizing the project's problem structure](/img/pm/problem_solving_current_reality_tree.png)

The current reality tree visualized the **complex problem structures and negative spirals lurking within the organization**. Through interviews and deliverable analyses, the following issues became clear:

1. **Overload of development leaders**  
   Pending issues and reviews were delayed, making the leadership layer a bottleneck.  
2. **Tool management becoming a formality**  
   Redundant management in Redmine and Excel was occurring, exacerbating the workload.  
3. **Lack of talent development mechanisms**  
   Systematic skill development was not happening, resulting in underqualified team members.  
4. **Inadequate project management control**  
   Due to insufficient internal capabilities, there was increased wholesale outsourcing to partner companies, and lax subcontractor management led to frequent plan deviations.  
5. **Weak sense of ownership toward the product**  
   An increase in makeshift tasks contributed to a decline in quality.

## The Reality of the Negative Spirals
When organizing the issues, they boiled down to two root causes: ‚Äúoverload of development leaders‚Äù and ‚Äúinsufficient product development capabilities.‚Äù These generated the following two negative spirals:

- **Spiral 1**  
  Work overload ‚Üí Decreased sense of responsibility ‚Üí Turnover ‚Üí Resource shortage  
- **Spiral 2**  
  Skill shortage ‚Üí Quality decline ‚Üí Increased defects ‚Üí Higher failure costs

## Designing a Future Reality Tree and Positive Spirals

![Example of using a Future Reality Tree to set intermediate goals from root causes](/img/pm/problem_solving_future_reality_tree.png)

Based on the causal relationships transformed into ‚Äúdesired states,‚Äù we mapped out **the formation of positive spirals and the path to the business goals**. To break the negative spirals, we replaced them with the following ‚Äúdesired states‚Äù:
- Distribution of workload  
- Skill enhancement for team members  
- Establishment of a product development system with a strong sense of ownership  

This enabled **the formation of positive spirals and clarified the path to achieving the business goals.**

## Detailing Solutions | Short-Term and Long-Term Improvement Approaches
To address the root causes, we examined and implemented the following solutions:

| Root Cause to Eliminate                | Resolved State                          | Solutions to Eliminate                                    |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Overload of development leaders        | Work distribution and efficiency gains  | Procure external PMs, introduce PM support tools           |
| Insufficient product development capabilities | Skill enhancement                       | Formulate development plans, design training programs      |

**In the short term, we focused on removing bottlenecks; in the long term, we advanced structural improvements through development strategies.**

# Conclusion | Execution Strategies to Link Problem-Solving with Results
In this article, we explained the process that starts with the future vision drawn in a cause-and-effect diagram and leads to problem-solving through the setting of intermediate goals and drafting of execution plans. **To guide ‚Äúvisualized‚Äù problems toward ‚Äúresolution,‚Äù a loop of execution and verification is essential.**

Don‚Äôt stop at simply visualizing the problems. **Translating solutions into action is the first step toward on-site improvement.**
