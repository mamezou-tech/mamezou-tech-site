This is the 20th article of the [Mamezou Developer Site Advent Calendar 2023](/events/advent-calendar/2023/).

## Introduction
I'm Ogawa, participating in the Advent Calendar out of a desire for novelties. Following a move this summer, I was given my own workspace, so I'll introduce my remote work environment. Before moving, I was working in a back-breaking environment with a low table and a floor chair, but now I work very comfortably. Despite the limited budget, I am satisfied with my first attempt at setting up a remote work environment.

## My Work Style
Since the start of remote work in 2020, I generally work from home unless there is a need to go to the office. As I'm part of the embedded systems division, I go to the office when real machine testing is necessary, but I mostly bunker down at home for front-end tasks like GUI development.

## Overview
This is what it looks like when I sit down.

It's a basic environment with a light tone in mind.

### Desk
I had planned to have enough space and had a slight longing for an L-shaped desk, so I purchased an [L-shaped desk from LOWYA](https://amzn.asia/d/6Ymxjyp). It has a reassuring feel that regular desks don't offer, which is very nice. Although not shown in the photo, my home PC, a MacBook, is placed to the left. The upper shelf adds a distinct desk feel.

### Curtains
I bought the curtains from Nitori. Curtains set the room's atmosphere. I chose a gentle green to allow for calm work. Gentle on the eyes = green, perhaps a bias from my elementary school days.

### Clock
Also from Nitori, I bought a cloud motif digital clock. You might think, "I can see the time on my PC, and it's digital too." But what's important is the temperature and cuteness. I keep the temperature adjusted between 21°C and 24°C. Going over 25° leads to sleepiness, so I'm quite careful about it.

## Chair
Indeed, the most crucial element is the chair. When moving, I visited a furniture fair organized by [Kanetaya](https://www.kanetaya.com/makuhari_messe/) to furnish my home and sat on numerous chairs.

Then, I encountered [DuoRest](http://www.duorest.jp/).

The fit for the lower back is extraordinary. I decided to buy it the moment I sat down. Really. It's been almost five months since the move, and I've been working from home without any back pain.

## Gadgets
I don't have particular preferences for gadgets, so I'll keep this brief.

### Keyboard
![](/img/blogs/2023/1214_remote-env013_003.png)

It's a [mechanical keyboard from METIS](https://www.amazon.co.jp/METIS-%E3%83%A1%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8B%E3%82%AB%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89-%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9F%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9C%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89-Bluetooth-LED%E3%83%90%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88/dp/B07PQ2ZFBM). "Royal Kludge" is the original manufacturer, and "METIS" might be an OEM. I don't quite understand it, but I bought it simply because I wanted to try a mechanical keyboard. The typing feel is good, but it's a bit noisy for use outside. I've been using it for about three and a half years.

### Mouse

It's a [mouse from Elecom](https://elecom.co.jp/products/M-XGM10DBBK.html). The EX-G series is safe and easy to use. I'm curious about trackball mice these days, but I've heard once you start using them, it's hard to stop, and they're a bit pricey.

### Headset
Purchased from DAISO. It works safely and well. Not worth a photo since it's not used much for Zoom.

## Looking Ahead

### Additional Monitor
Currently, I'm working with only one monitor provided by the company. I'm considering adding a vertically oriented monitor. While working in an IDE is better horizontally, documentation and catching up on materials feel better vertically.

### Introduction of a PC Stand
It's one of those items I haven't bought just because everyone else has. I don't feel the need yet, but I'd like to try it to see if it reduces strain. It's similar to the overseas notion that "there's no shoulder pain." I've spent a quarter-century thinking I had no shoulder pain, but it turns out I was just famously stiff.

## Extra
I'll show you the right side of the [desk](#デスク).

![](/img/blogs/2023/1214_remote-env013_005.png)
It has become a space for collecting empty whiskey bottles. I prefer Irish whiskey, so it's prominently displayed. My motto is delicious and cheap, so I'm trying supermarket whiskeys as they come. I could write another article if I started talking about it, but unfortunately, it would likely be for a different platform.

Thank you for your time.
