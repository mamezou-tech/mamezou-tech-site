Happy New Year. This is the summary for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2023.

## Number of Articles & Authors
In these three months, 47 articles were posted, bringing the total to 522 articles. This means we have surpassed 500 articles within two years since the site's launch. There were 6 new authors.

## Trends in Each Category

### Robotics
The number of articles on robotics is steadily increasing.

This year again, we had a collection of excellent articles. Advent calendar articles often continue to attract traffic over time, so we look forward to this year's articles. There were also two authors who made their debut this time.

## Site Improvements

### Mameka's Bean Knowledge Column has moved to GPT-4 Turbo
The column "Mameka's Bean Knowledge" on the homepage, which has been well received by some, has been updated from AI GPT-4 to GPT-4 Turbo. It now explains IT jargon more fluently than before. Please continue to enjoy it.

### Switched SSG to Lume
Since the site's launch, we have been using Eleventy for SSG, but we have moved to [Lume](https://lume.land/), an SSG based on Deno. The great development experience of Deno is also contributing to the excellent writing experience with Lume. A series of introductory articles on Lume has also started.

### Site Search Improvement
We have been using Google site search, but we have re-implemented it using a search service called Algolia. The UI and search results have been improved, so please try it out.
