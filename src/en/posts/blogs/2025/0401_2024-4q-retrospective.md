We have entered the 2025 fiscal year. This is the summary for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024.

## Number of Articles and Authors
Over the past three months, 32 articles were published. The total article count has surpassed 700, reaching 711. One new author made their writing debut, bringing the total to 64. With the busy season at the start of the year (or rather, the busy period at the end of the fiscal year), the number of posts is slightly lower. ‚§µÔ∏è

## Series Articles

### Introduction to TypeScript for Java Engineers
A TypeScript introduction targeting Java engineers. The 9th article in the series has been published.

### The "Maven You Can't Ask Now" Series
A series delivering tips for Maven. After a long hiatus, a new article has been published.

## Articles on Specific Themes

### Robotics Related
In the robotics category, two articles have been published.

An article providing a detailed explanation of the DQN algorithm. I believe it is useful not only for robotics.

An introduction to the domestically produced robot simulator Choreonoid.

### textlint and VS Code Integration
The following articles explain a generic mechanism for displaying CLI output within the VS Code editor, which should be helpful for those looking to implement similar functionality.

@[og](/blogs/2025/01/27/textlint-tuning-allowlist/)

On the developer site‚Äôs writing environment, proofreading using textlint is available; however, the results were output to the terminal. Along with the publication of these articles, a pull request was created and merged into the developer site repository to display proofreading results directly within the VS Code editor. üëç This will make proofreading much more efficient.

### Generative AI Related
Due to recent developments, there have been an increasing number of articles related to generative AI, including OpenAI and GitHub Copilot.

The issue of how to keep personal data stored in databases and logs confidential is an important topic for every company. It seems that the adoption of generative AI‚Äìpowered solutions is also progressing.

An article introducing Perplexity‚Äôs new API, known for its search capabilities.

### Diagram Series

Various themes are explored, but a highlight of this quarter was the number of articles that use diagrams for visual explanations. In addition to text and code snippets, explanations with diagrams make the content much easier to understand.

## Launch of Chinese Translation Articles
Following the English translation articles, we have also started publishing articles translated into Chinese using generative AI. Although there are fewer English translations, they have been steadily gaining traction‚Äîso we are expecting increased access from the Chinese-speaking community. Translated articles now include links to both the English and Chinese versions below the title.

## In Conclusion
That concludes the summary for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. I believe we are seeing an increase in in-depth articles that reflect the diverse expertise and interests of our authors.
