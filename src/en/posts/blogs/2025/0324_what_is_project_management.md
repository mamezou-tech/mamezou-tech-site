# Introduction
Hello, I'm Makoto Takahashi.
This article is intended for those who have not yet experienced the role of a PM (Project Management) or who aren’t quite sure what its scope entails.
We will clearly explain what a PM is, its meaning, and its role, with the ultimate goal of enabling you to explain Project Management to others.

# The Meaning of Project Management
## What is Project Management?
In the PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge), Project Management is defined as follows.
"Project Management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements." (From PMBOK 6th Edition)

## Breaking Down and Understanding Project Management
Just reading the PMBOK's description might make it hard to envision what project management is.
Since we're at it, let's take an engineering approach by breaking down project management to thoroughly understand its meaning.
Project Management consists of the following two elements:
- Project
- Management

### What is a Project
A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. (From PMBOK 6th Edition)
For clarity, let’s explain each of its components:

- Uniqueness: New elements, uncertainty
- Temporality: Start date, end date
- Deliverables: Can result in success, cancellation, or failure

By the way, the opposite of project work is regular operations.
Regular operations refer to the routine tasks that are performed daily.

### What is Management
Management is a noun derived from the verb "manage" with the addition of the suffix "-ment".  
The suffix "-ment" turns a verb into a noun, though it doesn't carry any profound meaning.
Here, let's delve into the word "manage" itself.

Meaning of Manage (from Eijiro on the WEB):
- To use, handle, or manipulate (with skill, as with tools or weapons)
- To somehow accomplish or manage (through great effort amid difficulties)
- <Sarcastically> To end up doing something unpleasant carelessly
- To tame, discipline, or control (difficult individuals or animals)
- To run (manage, operate) a company, etc.

Since a project is about delivering a unique product or service within a deadline, personally, the second definition, "to somehow accomplish," resonates the most.

## The Meaning of Project Management
Having broken down project management thus far, let’s now combine the elements to grasp its overall meaning.
Project Management can be defined as "doing whatever it takes to accomplish what seems difficult in order to deliver a product or service that has never existed before within an established deadline."
And the person responsible for this role is called a project manager.

# Explaining Project Management with a Concrete Example
Because the above explanation is a bit lengthy, when explaining it more concretely, I usually say:
"Project management is the experience of managing the sequence and parallel relationships of tasks using flowcharts or time charts to track progress toward achieving a goal."

# Bonus
I love the game “ロマンシングサガ - ミンストレルソング -” and, believe it or not, I have cleared it over 40 times and played it for more than 1,000 hours.
There is a scene in it that I felt also relates to project management, so allow me to introduce it.
In the game, there is an item called the "Destiny Stone" that plays an important role in defeating the final boss.
The inexperienced protagonist, still unready to stop the final boss, discovers the Destiny Stone in a temple.
Hesitant to take the Destiny Stone, the protagonist consults a deity for guidance, and the deity says the following:
"Take that Destiny Stone and, as a representative of all living things in the world, stop Sarūin (the final boss). If you are incapable, then find someone who can and hand over the Destiny Stone. That is your mission."
No matter how many times I watch this scene, I can’t help but be captivated by it.
As a project manager, what I learned from Romancing SaGa is that "in order to achieve a goal, you must do whatever it takes."
Saying "do whatever it takes" might be a bit misleading, but it means involving everyone around you—customers, superiors, experts—and leveraging all available resources, tools, and techniques to achieve your goal.
Of course, you must always adhere to the rules set by your project or organization and never do anything that violates laws or ethics!

# Summary
Project Management is about "achieving the objective of a task that is unique and temporary."
And while a project manager will do whatever it takes to implement project management and achieve the goal, they will always strictly adhere to compliance.
